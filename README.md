# NoLock
Security Awareness page for people who do not lock their desktop.

## Features
- The page contains all elements inline, even the shown images for the background and bitcoin. Additionally, the warning image is an inline SVG. There are also no references to other libraries, so this page can be used offline as well.
- Currently the countdown will automatically start and counts down till 04:13:37 the next day, so this page can be opened on multiple screens of a single desktop and timers will be (almost) synchronised.
- A button is added to trigger the page to open fullscreen. After 10 seconds this button will automatically hide.

## Installation
Just deploy the page to a webserver and open it up. No additional installation steps are required.
